# MyReads Project

This is an assignment project for the React Course in Udacity.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Troubleshooting
If you have problems running this application, try removing the node_modules and run `npm install` again. It's possible to have some issues if you don't have the `react-scripts` module install globally.

## TODOs

* Fix glitch when typing for certain criteria in the search bar (maybe blovking occurs when typing too fast).


## Improvements

* Search needs at least 3 letter word for searching. This minimize the number of requests to the server.


##Â Search Terms

* Using search component you can type for some keywords defined like **art** or **android** to test functionality.
* You can take a look at some search terms defined for this assignment. Please look at [search terms file](./SEARCH_TERMS.md) for more examples.
