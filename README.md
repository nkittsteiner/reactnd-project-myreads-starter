# MyReads Project

This is an assignment project for the React Course in Udacity.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Troubleshooting
If you have problems running this application, try removing the node_modules and run `npm install` again. It's possible to have some issues if you don't have the `react-scripts` module install globally.

## TODOs

* Fix a glitch when looking for certain criteria in the search bar (or typing to fast).


## Improvements

* Search needs at least 3 letter word for searching. This minimize the number of requests to the server.
